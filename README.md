# Nuclear Waffle
Awful and painful minecraft modpack with [GregTech](https://github.com/GregTech6/gregtech6), [RotaryCraft](https://github.com/ReikaKalseki/RotaryCraft), the [Nuclear Tech Mod](https://github.com/HbmMods/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT), and others

### minecraft version: 1.7.10
 **currently under development, recently started**

- aims to cross over the larger tech mods
  - above, NTM, GT, RotaryCraft
  - we also have the mainline mods like enderIO, thermal, applied energistics but they are more of aiding
- heavily tweaked
- progression, likely, uuuh
- its supposed to go on a semi-public server, if you want in, ask on [discord](https://discord.gg/NTYMgvZeM7)

beware of the memes

## PLEASE NOTE: you will need to download [chromaticcraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/chromaticraft) too since the file i had was larget than 100mb which does *not* fit into github
